# Business Plan: FastAd

## I. Executive Summary

**Mission:** To empower small and medium-sized sellers to expand their online sales simply, reliably, and efficiently by centralizing ads across multiple marketplaces and saving time.

**The Problem:** Small and medium-sized sellers (SMEs) face a significant operational bottleneck: the high effort required to manually create and manage ads across multiple platforms.

> **Data Insight:** 55% of sellers identify "Inserting products manually" as their most significant daily challenge.

**Complexity Scaling:** Sellers operating on 4 or more marketplaces face 126% more operational challenges than single-channel sellers.

**The Solution:** FastAd is a SaaS Multi-Marketplace Ad Publishing Platform that centralizes product listings. By eliminating manual repetition, the platform reduces errors, ensures data consistency, and allows sellers to reach a wider audience with less effort.

## III. Marketing Plan

### 1. Target Audience & Segmentation

Data analysis reveals two primary segments within the SME market:

**Segment A: The "Emerging" Seller (85% of market)**

*   **Profile:** Less than 3 years of experience; catalog of fewer than 10 products.
*   **Needs:** Simple onboarding and educational content to overcome the "learning curve".

**Segment B: The "Power User" (15% of market)**

*   **Profile:** Spends 10+ hours/week managing listings; uses 3+ marketplaces.
*   **Behavior:** This segment showed a 5.0/5.0 interest score in automation features. They are the ideal "Early Adopters" and brand evangelists.

### 2. Marketing Mix (4Ps)

*   **Product:** Prioritize the "Product Publisher" and "Stock Sync" features, as these address the top two user complaints (manual entry and stock errors).
*   **Price:**
    *   Subscription (SaaS) model for recurring revenue.
    *   Tiered pricing (Freemium/Basic/Pro) to allow scalability from small catalogs to large inventories.
*   **Place (Distribution):**
    *   Self-service online platform (24/7 access).
    *   Distribution via partners (ERPs, agencies).
*   **Promotion:**
    *   **Digital:** SEO targeting "marketplace automation," Google Ads, and YouTube tutorials.
    *   **Education:** Content marketing to demonstrate ROI to small sellers.

## IV. Market Study

## V. Organizational Plan

### 1. Team Structure

*   **Business/Leadership:** Responsible for strategy, funding, and strategic partnerships.
*   **Development Department:** Focused on MVP architecture, API maintenance, and Cloud Infrastructure.
*   **Marketing & Sales:** Dedicated to CAC optimization and channel management.
*   **Customer Support:** Critical for the initial "high-touch" onboarding phase required by the 85% of users who are less experienced.

### 2. Human Resources Strategy

*   **Key Hires:** Backend Developers (API expertise) and UI/UX Designers (to maintain the "Simplicity" value).
*   **Culture:** A "Customer Focus" culture where feature development is prioritized based on user feedback data (e.g., the 55% demand for auto-publishing).

## VI. Operational Plan

### 1. Implementation Roadmap

*   **Phase 1: Initiation (0-3 Months):** Finalize legal documentation, assemble technical team, obtain initial investment, and launch marketing teaser.
*   **Phase 2: Development (3-6 Months):**
    *   **Goal:** Build MVP.
    *   **Priority:** Core "Product Publisher" + Amazon/OLX API integrations.
    *   **Milestone:** Functional Prototype and User Testing with "Power Users".
*   **Phase 3: Beta & Launch (6-12 Months):** Release Beta version, execute official marketing launch, and begin expansion to secondary marketplaces.

### 2. Risk Management

*   **Technological Risk (High):** Dependence on third-party APIs.
    *   **Mitigation:** Invest in R&D and maintain a flexible architecture to adapt to API changes.
*   **Competition Risk (High):** Established players.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on UX simplicity and local marketplace integrations (OLX/Facebook) that global giants miss.
*   **Financial Risk (Medium):** Cash flow management.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strict cash flow monitoring and tiered pricing to ensure diverse revenue streams.

## VII. Production Plan

### 1. Starting Point and Sales Program
The production plan is directly driven by the sales forecast from the marketing strategy. As a SaaS platform, "production" refers to ensuring the platform's capacity, features, and performance can meet the subscribed user demand.

### 2. Forecasting
*   **Quantities to be Produced:** This translates to the number of user accounts, API calls, and data storage required. The infrastructure will be designed to scale based on the tiered subscription model (Freemium, Basic, Pro).
*   **Stock of Raw Materials:** For a SaaS business, "raw materials" are the core software components, cloud infrastructure resources (server instances, database capacity), and third-party API licenses. Stock levels are managed through scalable cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure) and proactive resource allocation.

### 3. Description of Production Processes
The "production" process is a continuous software development and operations lifecycle:
1.  **Market Need Identification:** User feedback and data analysis (from the Marketing Plan) drive the feature roadmap.
2.  **Development & Integration:** The development team builds, tests, and integrates new features and API connections (e.g., for new marketplaces).
3.  **Deployment:** Code is deployed to the production environment using CI/CD pipelines for reliability.
4.  **Monitoring & Maintenance:** The platform's health, performance, and security are monitored 24/7 to ensure uptime and a smooth user experience.
5.  **Customer Support:** The support team provides user assistance, which feeds back into the need identification process.

### 4. Estimation of Production Costs
Production costs are primarily operational expenditures (OpEx) related to running the SaaS platform:
*   **Cloud Hosting Fees:** Costs for servers, databases, and data transfer (e.g., AWS/Azure billing). This is the primary "cost of goods sold."
*   **API & Licensing Costs:** Fees for using third-party marketplace APIs or licensed software components.
*   **Personnel Costs:** Salaries for the Development, Operations, and Customer Support teams.
*   **Monitoring & Security Tools:** Costs for software used to maintain platform health and security.

### 5. Estimating Production Costs per Unit
The "unit" is a single user subscription. The cost per unit is calculated by dividing the total production costs by the number of active users.
*   **Cost per User = Total Monthly OpEx / Number of Active Users**
This metric is critical for ensuring that the pricing tiers (Price from the 4Ps) are profitable and that the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is sustainable relative to the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a customer.

## VIII. Financial Plan

### 1. Key Assumptions

*   **Initial Investment:** €500,000.
*   **Revenue Growth:** 25% per annum.

### 3. Financial Projections & ROI

*   **Return on Investment (ROI):**
    *   **Short Term:** 24%.
